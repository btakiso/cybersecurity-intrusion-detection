# Setup Guide - Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Project

## Quick Start Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

**Option A: Using the provided script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install kagglehub if not already installed
pip install kagglehub

# Run the download script
python download_dataset.py
```

**Option B: Manual download**
1. Go to [Kaggle Dataset Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnkumars/cybersecurity-intrusion-detection-dataset)
2. Click "Download" button to get `cybersecurity_intrusion_data.csv`
3. Save the file in the `data/` directory of this project

### Step 2: Set Up Environment
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Step 3: GitHub Repository Setup
✅ **Already completed!** 
Repository: https://github.com/btakiso/cybersecurity-intrusion-detection
Raw dataset URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btakiso/cybersecurity-intrusion-detection/main/data/cybersecurity_intrusion_data.csv

### Step 4: Run Google Colab Notebook
1. Open `notebooks/cybersecurity_regression_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. All URLs and repository links are already configured
3. Simply run all cells to execute the analysis

### Step 5: Run the Analysis
1. Execute all cells in the Colab notebook
2. Review the results and visualizations
3. Save your notebook with outputs

## Project Completion Checklist ✅

- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Repository created and populated
- [ ] Dataset downloaded and uploaded to repository
- [ ] Google Colab notebook completed with all required sections:
  - [ ] Dataset source and variable selection comments
  - [ ] Regression model implementation
  - [ ] Training dataset visualization
  - [ ] Regression model visualization
  - [ ] Prediction analysis and interpretation
- [ ] Both GitHub repository URL and Google Colab link ready for submission

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Dataset not loading in Colab**
- Make sure the GitHub raw URL is correct
- Ensure the dataset file is uploaded to your repository
- Check that the file is in the `data/` directory

**Issue: Import errors**
- Run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` in the first Colab cell
- Or install packages individually: `!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

**Issue: Model performance is poor**
- This is normal for the demonstration dataset
- The focus is on implementing the regression workflow correctly
- Real dataset performance may vary
